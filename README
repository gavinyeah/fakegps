Readme for FakeGPS
------------------

Introduction
------------
FakeGPS is a development tool for creating location-aware applications on the
Android platform. The application itself does not run on Android, but instead
on the development workstation used by the application developer.

With FakeGPS the developer can create a virtual path, which is sent to the
Android device or emulator through the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) tool.
